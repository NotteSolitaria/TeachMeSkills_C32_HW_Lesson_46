# List of tasks:
1. Write tests for a simple class that performs basic mathematical operations. Create a Calculator class and implement the methods:Addition(add),Subtract(subtract),Multiplication(multiply), Division(divide).
2. Write tests for the Calculator class:
   Check that all methods work correctly:
    - For add, check several cases (for example, positive and negative numbers).
    - For subtract, check that the result is correct for different inputs.
    - For multiply, check that the result is correct for zero and negative numbers.
    - For divide, check the correctness of the division and the handling of division by zero (an exception is raised).
